# Kai-Britzman-E-Portfolio

My name is Kai Britzman. I'm an Applied Data Science student at Harper Adams University. One of my modules is Professional and Study Skills. In this module, we have learnt a variety of soft skills that can be used for my time at university and in the work place. This repository will show what I have learnt in this module and how I plan to enhance my skills. This is done as a e-portfolio in a GitHub webpage. All the content is on one page.
