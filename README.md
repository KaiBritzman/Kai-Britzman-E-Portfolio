# Kai-Britzman-E-Portfolio

# Introduction
My name is Kai Britzman. I'm a Applied Data Science student at Harper Adams University. I'm currently in my first year and have learnt a variety of modules, including Proffesional and Study Skills, Computing Technology and Data Visualisation. I have learnt lots of technical aspects in Computing Technology and Data Visualisation, like coding, problem solving and more importantly, i have learnt how to present my data in Data Visualisation. I now have foundational skills in R programming and plotting graphs, which is a skill scarce in the data science workplace. 
Proffesional and Study Skills however is a module with skills that will take me anywhere. Computing Technology has given me skills i can still take outside of Data Science, like software engineering, web development or any other programming dominiant job. Data visualisation however is completely tailored to data science and fields similar. In Proffesional and Study Skills however, i have learnt a variety of material that will transfer to any tech jobs, ones that are programming dominiant and some that have no programming involved whatsoever. In this e-portfolio, i will explain what i have learnt from this important module, and how having these skills will make me more valuable in the workforce and business world. 

## Enterprise Authoring and Presentation Tools
During the module, we learnt about Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint. These are tools that i was already familiar with and i used it for many things. I have used Word and PowerPoint in school for Imedia and other courses. I then used it much more prodominently during College which was esstenially all we used. All presentations were on PowerPoint, and every module, apart from the exam modules, had a presentation. We then used Word for most other things like research, specification documents, evaluation etc. We also used Excel alot for gannt charts, which was present in every module, apart from exam modules. 
From the lectures we have had about this topic, i have identified lots of strengths with Microsoft 365 (Microsoft 365 is like a package that allows you to access Microsoft Word, PowerPoint etc). The first strength is its easy to use and efficient. The interface for all Microsoft 365 applications are simple and easy to follow. All commands and tabs are in the ribbon, which is a banner at the top of the screen. They also have a navigation bar, which means all tabs are organised and its easy to find what you are looking for. When you hover over each tab with your cursor, there is a mini description of what it does. This makes it even easier to learn on your own and discover things as you use it.
For word, i learnt how to use it very efficently. I learnt lots of new keyboard shortcuts. I knew the basic ones, like ctr V, ctr C and ctr A. I have become very efficent in using these shortcuts over the years. However, i never ventured beyond that. I mostly manually did stuff using the ribbons like undoing and redoing work. However, while it doesnt take a long time, a few seconds at most, it can make my work flow much more sluggish and have no sense of speed about it. After learning about the various shortcuts for different functions in Word, i now have a new mindset about work efficentcy. This will come with practise and making the effort to do it when i need to. 

Microsoft 365 applications are used for academic and proffesional uses. The strenghts of these applications for academic use is its simplicity. Using Microsoft Word and PowerPoint is very simple to use. For Word, you can easily write reports and essays. You can simply use the underline feature to make headings and you simply type your content. For PowerPoint, you can easily make aesthetic prsentations with its in-built backgrounds and ability to import shapes and models and for different slide transitions. Another strength for using it academiclly is its used in the workforce and you are building basic skills. If you are working in a office, or non physical job, you will almost definetly use Word, PowerPoint or Excel. You will use Excel a lot if you are an accountant or work with datasheets. You will use Word for reports to clients for all kinds of jobs like digital marketing or consulting. You will then use PowerPoint for presentations for clients or co-workers for any job that involves a computer. 
Overall, you will almost always encounter Microsoft 365 in your job, So, using them academically will build your skills early, instead of learning it on the job. Most people will also have these skills, so if you don't, you will be at a big disadvantage. 
As with everything though, there are weaknesses. One is cost. You will need a licsense to access Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel etc. This can be expensive, espically for a school or college, with hundreds, if nots thousands of computers and accounts that will need access to it. 
Another one is learning curve. While Microsoft 365 has a simple interface,
