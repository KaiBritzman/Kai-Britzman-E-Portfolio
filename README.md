# Kai-Britzman-E-Portfolio

My name is Kai Britzman. I'm a Applied Data Science student at Harper Adams University. One of my modules is professional and study skills. In this module, we have learnt a variety of softskills that can be used for my time at University and in the work force. This repository will show what I have learnt in this module and how I plan to enhance my skills. This is done as a e-portfolio in a GitHub webpage. All the content is on one page.
