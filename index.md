# Introduction
My name is Kai Britzman. I'm a Applied Data Science student at Harper Adams University. I'm currently in my first year and have learnt a variety of modules, including Proffesional and Study Skills, Computing Technology and Data Visualisation. I have learnt lots of technical aspects in Computing Technology and Data Visualisation, like coding, problem solving and more importantly, I have learnt how to present my data in Data Visualisation. I now have foundational skills in R programming and plotting graphs, which is a skill scarce in the data science workplace. 
Professional and Study Skills however is a module with skills that will take me anywhere. Computing Technology has given me skills I can still take outside of Data Science, like software engineering, web development or any other programming dominiant job. Data visualisation however is completely tailored to data science and fields similar. In Proffesional and Study Skills however, I have learnt a variety of material that will transfer to any tech jobs, ones that are programming dominiant and some that have no programming involved whatsoever. In this e-portfolio, I will explain what I have learnt from this important module, and how having these skills will make me more valuable in the workforce and business world. 

## Enterprise Authoring and Presentation Tools
During the module, we learnt about Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint. These are tools that I was already familiar with and I used it for many things. I have used Word and PowerPoint in school for Imedia and other courses. I then used it much more prodominently during College which was esstenially all we used. All presentations were on PowerPoint, and every module, apart from the exam modules, had a presentation. We then used Word for most other things like research, specification documents, evaluation etc. We also used Excel alot for gannt charts, which was present in every module, apart from exam modules. 

However I have learnt a few new things. For word, I learnt how to use it very efficently. I learnt lots of new keyboard shortcuts. I knew the basic ones, like ctr V, ctr C and ctr A. I have become very efficent in using these shortcuts over the years. However, I never ventured beyond that. I mostly manually did stuff using the ribbons like undoing and redoing work. However, while it doesnt take a long time, a few seconds at most, it can make my work flow much more sluggish. After learning about the various shortcuts for different functions in Word, I now have a new mindset about work efficentcy. This will come with practice and making the effort to do it when I need to.

From the lectures we have had about this topic, I have identified lots of strengths with Microsoft 365 (Microsoft 365 is like a package that allows you to access Microsoft Word, PowerPoint etc). The first strength is its easy to use and efficient. The interface for all Microsoft 365 applications are simple and easy to follow. All commands and tabs are in the ribbon, which is a banner at the top of the screen. They also have a navigation bar, which means all tabs are organised and its easy to find what you are looking for. When you hover over each tab with your cursor, there is a mini description of what it does. This makes it even easier to learn on your own and discover things as you use it.

Another strength for using it academiclly is its used in the workforce and you are building basic skills. If you are working in a office, or non physical job, you will almost definetly use Word, PowerPoint or Excel. You will use Excel a lot if you are an accountant or work with datasheets. You will use Word for reports to clients for all kinds of jobs like digital marketing or consulting. You will then use PowerPoint for presentations for clients or co-workers for any job that involves a computer. 
Overall, you will almost always encounter Microsoft 365 in your job, So, using them academically will build your skills early, instead of learning it on the job. Most people will also have these skills, so if you don't, you will be at a big disadvantage. (Joseph Mhango)

As with everything though, there are weaknesses. One is cost. You will need a licsense to access Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel etc. This can be expensive, espically for a school or college, with hundreds, if nots thousands of computers and accounts that will need access to it. 
Another one is learning curve. While Microsoft 365 software have simple interfaces, they do have complicated functions built in. It can be overwhelming opening software and seeing all these buttons and not knowing what they do. Many students who go to College/University may get very overwhelmed because they have never had to use Microsoft tools due to their choice of subjects/courses being primarily exams and written work. So, it can be a big learning curve.

AI is a tool that many people use for their work. Well known ones being ChatGPT and Copliot. However, most people access these AI tools on the internet. This means as they work, they have to have two windows up to use it. I used to do this however I have now learnt how to use AI within Microsoft Software. For Word, I now know how I can use it within the actual software and how I can use it to enhance my work. 

Right now, I would say I have intermediate level skills in Word and PowerPoint. I can make professional looking reports and presentations using the functions in the software. I would say I'm a beginner in using Excel. I havent used Excel excessively outside of University. I have only used it for gannt charts and occasionally making tables with data. So, Excel is something I need to use more extentsively to improve my skills. 

To make sure I achieve mastery in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, I will keep experimenting with the different functions and see what they do. I will also make sure to learn more keyboard shortcuts so I can become more efficient in my work. As I already have skills in these software, I just need to experiment on the more advanced functions.
For Excel, I will make sure to use Excel to store data and use it to analyse the data. This is directly linked to my course (Data Science) so it will be useful to make sure I have practical experience that I can bring to a future job. 

## Information Literacy
The internet has made it much easier to research and find information. Before, you had to go to libraries and read books to find it. Now, you can go onto the internet and find information on almost anything. However, the internet isnt always accurate. Anyone can use the internet and produce fake information. For my assignments in college and school, I used to use primarly google to research stuff that I didnt know. This wont cut it for University work and for work in the workforce. I developed a new mindeset when it comes to research. In professional and study skills, I have learnt how to use academic sources for informative and correct information.

The main academic catelogue I have learnt is Scopus. In Scopus, you can use keywords to find sources on information you want. For example, you may
want to research on how AI can be used to enhance education. You will likely have key words like AI, edcuation etc. You can then find journals that have information on those topics. You may have thousands of results, but you can filter them using years they were published, the country of publication etc. To make sure your search results are goodm, try to experiment with the key words. Sometimes people use different words to you, so using a variety of words can help you find the sources you want. 

PICO is a method to break a question down into different sections to help with reasearch. PICO is an acronym. P is who/what is being studied. This could be a certain type of soil for example. Then I which is the change/condition. This could be intense rain conditions. Then C is what you are comparing it against, which could be intense heat/drought. Then O is what you measyre, like yield. This helps you come up with keywords that you can then use on Scopus to find journals/articles on your chosen topic. The strength of this is its simply to conduct and easy to remember because its an acronym. A weakness however is that is not very flexibile as it focus on a set question structure and is biased to quantitive based research, as most questions designed this way include numeric data that changes because of certain conditions. (Joseph Mhango)

Evaluting sources for credibility is very important. This is because many sources contain misinformation. They may have conducted false research and gave the wrong figures or just get definitions wrong. Because of this, many people are taking in false information as true and using it in their assignment or research paper. Giving the wrong information shows that you don't know what you are talking about. Also, using sources with wrong information can lead to false conclusions if conducting research, which could ruin a companies reputation if done coporately, and can lose you lots of marks if done academically. So, making sure that your sources are reliable by looking at who published it and seeing their reputation, then seeing when it was written, so the information isn't outdated. It may have been correct, but it's now useless as concepts may evolve overtime. 

My current searching skills are in-between beginner and intermediate. I can use libraries like Scopus and I know how to filter stuff I don't want and how to use keywords. However I can sometimes struggle with finding specific things I want. I will however continue to develop my skills by using them during my assignments over my whole time at University. I will be able to put my skills to real practice, and I can see how I have improved by looking at my assignments now and how they were before. If my searching skills improved, my reference lists will be longer and I would have included more obscure knowledge. 

## Coding and Collaboration Platforms
Before I started this module, I didn't know about Git, GitHub or GitHub Pages. I didn't even hear about them, so this was a big learning curve. 

Git allows you to commit changes to your project and lets you access that whenever you want. This means when you do another commit, you can still access your previous commit. This means you dont lose your previous work. 
Github also allows for collaboration. You need to create a repository, which is where you store your project files. Then, you can invite people to join your repository and let people work on them. This allows for easy collaboration, as you dont have to create unique repositorys for each person working on the project, you can all work in one. 
GitHub can also let you present your work to the world. GitHub is like social media, where you have a profile and others can view your work if your repository is public. This is great for potential employers to see your practical work and for topics to bring up in interviews. It can also give people great ideas and overall develops peoples interest in you. 
GitPages are also great to display to the public your knowledge. GitHub webpages are websites made from GitHub. For example, I used Github webpages for my Data Visualisation assignment. It had all my knowledge I learnt from that module, with coded examples. My future employers can see this and they get see my knowledge of visualisation. Someone else may have similar knowledge, but because I have something like this public, I will be more likely hired. (Joseph Mhango, Ed Harris)

Git and Github are similar but different things. Think of Git as like a draft folder. It keeps snapchats of your project which means you can access older versions of your projecsts. GitHib is a website that lets you host Git repositories. This allows you to open codespaces and use git commands for version control. Esstentially, git is keeping different verisons of your project, and GitHub is a place where you can do that. (Joseph MHango)
Some git commands include ```git status```. This is will show what branch you are on, which files have been modifited and more. It esstentially shows how your repository is right now.  It's best practice to do this frequently (Joseph MHango 2025). ```git add``` moves your changes in your working directory into the staging area. It wont produce a output if done correctly. ```git commit``` will produce a new commit. This means it will produce a snapchat of all your changes, meaning you can access it whenever. I used this command the most when using git during my time at University, as it allows me to version control. 

As this is my first time using git as a whole, I have had many strengths and challenges when using it. For example, one of my main challenges is using commands and understanding the technical aspects of git. This has been a struggle to understand, however as I come to use it more, I will also come to undertand how it works technically. Some strengths I do have is creating repositorys, code spaces, commits and making GitHub webapges. I have used these for other aspects of my course. For example I have used codespaces and commits for the Computing and Technology course extentsively, and can confidently make a GitHub webpage because it is what we use for the majority of our written assignments. 

Collaborative tools like GitHub will be used heavley for my academic and professional journey. This is because many assignments may ask us to work in pairs. This is where collaborative tools like GitHub will help. for example, one assignment may ask us to make a software solution and we have to work in pairs. GitHub will allow us to create one repository and let other people make edits in the codespace. This is similar for my professional development. In the work force, there will certainly be times I have to work with other people. A client may ask for a big software solution, so we need mutliple people working on it to make the deadline the client wants. Having these collaboritve tools like let us work at the same time. 

I'm still a beginner with git and have a lot to learn. I can do commits, having a basic understanding of repositories and how git works. However, I will be able to improve my skills by doing more projects on GitHub for University assignments. This will naturally allow me to use GitHub more and know more about it. 

## Continuous Profesional Development(CPD)
My professional development is important to make sure that I'm employable and have a good online presence. Professional development is improving your skills and being able to present yourself well. I knew about these things but I never knew how to apply them or how to start. So, this part of the module has been useful. 

They are many ways to do this. One is to join professional networks like Linkedln. These are websites/apps where you have your own profile, like a short description of yourself and links to other professional networks you may be on. As well as that, you will have your experience in the work force, education and projects. I already have an Indeed account, where I have already applied to many part time jobs. It's not fully developed, and I didn't really know how useful having a good professional online presence is. In the future, I will be developing a Linkedln, explaining my experience and education. This will show to future employers I'm capable to do good work. It may also lead to new contacts as people can find my profile and send me a message. 

I also now fully understand my programme specifications and key academic milestones. I can look at the modules in my course, and I can identify what skills I will get from them. I also know how I can apply these skills, by doing assignments or work placements. For example, I know one of my modules is Real World AI, which will give lots of knowledge of how machine learning algorithms work. I also know I will be able to show my skills in the assignments for the module and I know I can do online courses to further practice and show my skills. I also now know the holidays (christmas, easter, and summer holidays) is the best time to do work placements to allow for more practical and real world practice. 

These things combined can allow me to achieve marketable graduate attributes. This is because I know how where I can present myself online, allowing people to find me online. This will also mean they can see physically what I have done, like projects, instead of me just talking about it. I also know how I can apply my skills I learn on my course, and opportunities where I can do this. Esstentially, understanding my course specifications and where I can improve my skills, will allow me to stand out more in professional networks, as I can put more unique content on them. 

As I'm at the start of my university degree, I'm still a beginner when it comes to skills related to my course and experience. However, as my course goes on, I will discover more opportunties and new skills to learn. By doing a combination of practicing on my own time and doing assignment related work, I will improve my skills and improve my professional online presence as I will have more skills to show and talk about. 

## Reponsible Use of AI
A few years ago, people didn't understand what AI was, but now almost everyone knows what it is. Most people may recognise it as just something people use for research and making it write assignments for them. However, it can be a powerful tool if used right (Ed Harris 2025). 

I already knew what most of what the OKs are for AI and what are the not OK's. Where you can use AI is for ideas for assignments, like how to structure the document and use ideas from AI but write them in your own words and make sure to elevate it with your own ideas. You also use it make practice questions for exams, make a diagram of graphic and getting feedback (Harper Adams). I have used AI for previous assignments for this reason. To make sure I have met all the critrea of the assignment brief and to make sure the content makes sense and ideas I explained are correct. 
Some not OK's are using it as your only source of information, not checking if the answers produced are correct, directly coping an AI answer, coping referencs made up by AI and adding personal details to the AI prompt because of data protection and senistive information (Harper Adams). 

To make sure you avoid plagiarism and making sure your work is your own, you should make sure to write your ideas in your own ideas and add personal touchs. You can get ideas from AI, however to make sure its your own work, you need to write it in your own style, not copying and pasting, and making sure you elevate it by adding your own ideas. This way the idea is more original and avoids plagiarism. 

To make sure I engage with evolving AI polices in my future career, is to make sure I read the news and any blogs the company I work for may write. This way, I know what is happening, I'm making sure to stay up-to-date with how my company is planning to use/implement AI. I can look at other companies blogs, however It is best if I read my own companies blogs, so I know more specifically what they want to do, rather than another company. 

I have a strong foundational knowledge on AI as a user, but I'm still a beginner when it comes to how machine learning algorithms work and how to use it as a professional, not a user. I will naturally develop my skills in the Real World AI module and other AI modules on my course. I can also develop more skills with online courses with websites like coursea and watch YouTube videos on them.
